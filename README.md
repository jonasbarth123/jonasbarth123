### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a PhD student in finance using deep learning to solve quantitative theory models with a focus on the impact of default.<br>

My work:<br>
  + tech tools: neural nets, reinforcement learning, DDPG, PyTorch
  + econ tools: general equilibrium, complete markets, incomplete markets, default
 
<br>

My repos contain examples using reinforcement learning to solve default models.<br>
